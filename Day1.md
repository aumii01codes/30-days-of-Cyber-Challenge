Today is the first day of this challenge and I'll discuss the basics so that everyone going through this is comfortable with whatever comes next.<br />

**What are cyber attacks?**<br />
Cyber attacks are malicious attempts to access into a network system.<br />

**What can happen in a cyber attack?**<br />
In a cyber attack, unauthorized individual can steal data and disrupt service.
They can also aim to cause damage, spy or extortion.
Organizations faces financial losses, reputational damage and/or legal consequences.<br />

**What are the different types of cyber attack?**<br />
Malware Attacks, Phishing Attacks, Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks,
SQL Injection Attacks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks, Credential Reuse Attacks, Social Engineering Attacks, Insider Threats, Zero-Day Exploits.<br />

**What is data breach?**<br />
A data breach is when unauthorized individual gain access to the sensitive or confidential data. It may also happen in accidental reveals or due to insider threats.<br />

**What are bugs?**<br />
A bug refers to a vulnerability or flaw within hardware or software that can be exploited by attackers to obtain unauthorized access.<br />
But, it is important to note that not all bugs are vulnerabilities, some are just errors in code that cause software to malfunction without posing a security risk.<br />

**Who are black hat hackers?**<br />
A person who uses their skills to gain unauthorized access into a network. They violate laws.<br />

**Why is protection against cyber attacks needed?**<br />

**Who are ethical hackers?**<br />
A person who uses their skill to test the organisation's system for any security vulnerability, operates within legal and ethical boundaries and typically have organization's permission.
They are also called *white hat hacker*.<br />

**What is bug bounty?**<br />
It is a reward to whoever catches the vulnerability of a system and reports the details to the organization.
It is often offered by organizations as part of their cybersecurity efforts to incentivize researchers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities they discover.
